4. University notes 📚 - `TeX` Notes from my studies at Wrocław University of Science and Technology
    - Project [repository](https://github.com/Rafisto/uni) 📁
    - Additional [notes](https://github.com/Rafisto/uni/tree/master/inne) unrelated to my study programme 🗒️.
    - A set of [high school notes](https://github.com/Rafisto/school) in `markdown` 📓.
    - A full preparation for my [High School Exam in IT](https://github.com/Rafisto/MaturaAlgorithms) - Notably:
      - the implementation of over 20 algorithms in `Python` 🐍
      - the analysis of the exam results which I have conducted using `Matplotlib` 📊.
5. [An approach](https://github.com/Rafisto/c-back) to create a backend application in pure `C` 
6. [LED Control](https://github.com/Rafisto/led-control) - Web Driver for 2.4GHz MiBoxer LED Strip Controllers using Python `PySerial` and `Flask` 
    - Great thanks to the **author** [Reverse-Engineering the milight on-air protocol](https://hackaday.io/project/5888/logs) 🙌
    - And once again for the `cpp` [library](https://github.com/henryk/openmili), which I used to write a simple serial interface utilizing 2.4GHz NRF24L01 📲.
7. [rafisto.github.io](https://rafisto.github.io) - A personal website created using `React`, `Typescript` and `gh-pages`.
    - Utilizes the idea of so-called `JSON Mockup` servers which allow creating a static website without the need for a backend and rebuilding the project on every change 🔄.
8. JavaScript integration of the [FFT](https://github.com/Rafisto/WebFFT) algorithm using JavaScript. The app can be used to display the linear frequency spectrum of the audio  `  signal. It is, however, a proof of concept as JavaScript and ToneJS, at the time of writing this, is not suitable for such demanding calculations 🎶.
9. Personal GUI setup for [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) listed at [this repository](https://github.com/Rafisto/rice) - I use it daily on my laptop.
  - I was astonished by these repositories:
    - A script to [automate polybar & rofi customization](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes/) 🤖
    - Starter [neovim config](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) ⌨️
    - Watch Dogs inspired [GRUB Theming](https://github.com/VandalByte/dedsec-grub2-theme) 🎮
10. The entire [list](https://github.com/Rafisto/csharp) of my `C#` projects. I have started my programming journey with this language - I have learned a lot from it and they date  back to the time when I was still in primary school 🏫.
11. A set of small scripts to learn [bash](https://github.com/Rafisto/sh) 🐚.
    - [Sort and copy files into a new directory](/organizer). Files are organized by their extension and the initial directory is left untouched. Contains dummy file generator `files.sh` and `organizer.sh` 📂.
    - [Gitlab: Batch create repositories, access tokens...](/gitlab/curl-functions.sh) Edit branch protection rules, remove repositories and list namespaces. All in one group management utility. Contains `curl-functions.sh`. Uses `.env` 🔧.
    - [Gitlab: Check if each repository in a group has more than one file](/gitlab/group-completion.sh). Helpful to track work by which repositories have changed from having only a template of README.md. Contains `group-completion.sh`. Uses `.env` 🔍.
    - [Find all git repositories in a directory with an undefined remote URL](/git/endangered-repositories.sh). Prints each repository directory which may be possibly endangered with unspecified remote. Contains `endangered-repositories.sh` 🚨.

... more to be added soon (haven't even finished describing my public github profile yet)
