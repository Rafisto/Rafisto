### Rafist0 👋 Rafał Włodarczyk 

(🌱) I was born and raised in Strzegom, Lower Silesia. Moved to Wroclaw and currently studying at ALO PWr.  
(🤔) Interested in discrete mathematics. Acquiring knowledge in IoT systems and web development.  

I love:
- ⚡ creating electronic circuits
- 🎸 playing electric guitar
- 📝 writing poems 
- 📚 reading classical literature.

(👯) I share my passions with others. Within the limits of my abilities, I try to instill in people the desire for action and self-development. I resolve conflicts with the help of Stoic philosophy and the teachings of Immanuel Kant.

(⛩) I am interested in different cultures, which I absorb by reading travel books and making online friends. As a result, I consistently expand my knowledge of the world. I enjoy traveling and immersing myself in the history and cultural values of the countries I visit. 

(🗣) Polish and English. Also, to a small extent, German and Spanish.

(🗺) In the long term, I intend to focus on the development of scientific and soft skills. In addition, I am going to do anything possible to remain an open-minded person, ready for knowledge and curious about the world.
