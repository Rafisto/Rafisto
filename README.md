## kubectl describe Rafisto ðŸŽ¸

I share my passions with others. Within the limits of my abilities, I try to instill in people the desire for action and self-development. I resolve conflicts with the help of Stoic philosophy and the teachings of Immanuel Kant.

I am interested in different cultures, which I absorb by reading travel books and making online friends. As a result, I consistently expand my knowledge of the world. I enjoy traveling and immersing myself in the history and cultural values of the countries I visit. 

In the long term, I intend to focus on the development of scientific and soft skills. In addition, I am going to do anything possible to remain an open-minded person, ready for knowledge and curious about the world.
