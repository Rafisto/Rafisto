### Rafist0

Welcome to my GitHub profile! üëã

Currently I work at: 
- [VIII 2023 - now] Wroclaw Networking and Supercomputing Center. My tasks include programming, server assembly and maintenance, and event organization.
- [XI 2022 - now] Academic High School of Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology - I teach classes in electronics. The series includes prototyping and manufacturing of electronic devices.

Let's:
- ‚ö° create electronic circuits
- üé∏ play electric guitar
- üìù write poems 
- üìö read classical literature

I share my passions with others. Within the limits of my abilities, I try to instill in people the desire for action and self-development. I resolve conflicts with the help of Stoic philosophy and the teachings of Immanuel Kant.

I am interested in different cultures, which I absorb by reading travel books and making online friends. As a result, I consistently expand my knowledge of the world. I enjoy traveling and immersing myself in the history and cultural values of the countries I visit. 

In the long term, I intend to focus on the development of scientific and soft skills. In addition, I am going to do anything possible to remain an open-minded person, ready for knowledge and curious about the world.
